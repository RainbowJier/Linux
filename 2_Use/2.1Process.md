## ðŸŽ¢1. Process

Here are some common Linux commands related to processes:

### 1.1 Listing Processes**

1. `ps`: Displays information about running processes.
    ```shell
    ps -ef   #(shows all processes with their parent processes)
    ps aux   #(shows all processes, including those of other users)
    ```

2. `top`: Displays a list of currently running processes and system resource usage.

3. `htop`: A more advanced version of top that provides additional information about processes.

### 1.2 Viewing Process Details

* `pmap <pid>`: Displays the memory map for a process with the given PID (process ID).
* `lsof -p <pid>`: Lists open files and network connections associated with a process.
* `strace -p <pid>`: Traces system calls made by a process.

### 1.3 Controlling Processes**

1. `kill <pid>`: Sends a signal to terminate a process (e.g., kill 1234).
    ```shell
    killall firefox  #(terminates all Firefox processes)
    ```

2. `killall -9 <process_name>`: Forces termination of a process without warning.
3. `renice <priority> <pid>`: Changes the nice value of a process, which affects its priority.

### 1.4 Monitoring Process Activity**

1. `sysdig`: A system debugging tool that provides detailed information about processes and their interactions with the
   kernel.
    ```shell
   sysdig -p 12345  # (monitors process activity for PID 12345)
   ```

2. `dtrace`: A dynamic tracing facility that allows you to monitor and analyze system calls made by processes.

### 1.5 Managing Process Priorities**

1. `nice <priority> <command>`: Runs a command with the specified nice value, which affects its priority.

    ```shell
    nice -n 10 firefox (runs Firefox with low priority)
    ```

2. `ionice`: Changes the I/O scheduling class of a process.

**6. Debugging Processes**

* `gdb`: A debugger that allows you to step through and inspect the code of a running process.
    + Example: `gdb firefox` (starts GDB for the Firefox process)
