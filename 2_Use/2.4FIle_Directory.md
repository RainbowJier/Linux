## 1. Delete File

The `rm` (remove) command is a fundamental tool for deleting files and directories on Linux systems.

Here's an overview of its usage:

```shell
rm [options] file1 [file2 ...]
```

* `file1`, `file2`, etc.: The names of the files or directories to be removed.

**Options:**

* `-i`: Interactive mode, prompting for confirmation before deleting each file.
* `-f`: Force removal without asking for confirmation. Be careful when using this option!
* `-r` or `-R`: Recursively remove a directory and all its contents (including subdirectories).
* `-v`: Verbose mode, showing the names of files being removed.

### 1.1 Common usage

1. Remove a single file:
    ```shell
    rm myfile.txt
    ```

2. Remove multiple files at once:
    ```shell
    rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
    ```


3. Remove an entire directory and all its contents (recursive):
    ```shell
    rm -r mydirectory/
    ```

4. Force removal of a file without prompting for `confirmation`(确认):

    ```shell
    rm -f myfile.txt
    ```

**Important notes:**

* Be careful when using `rm`! Once you delete a file, it's gone forever.
* Use the `-i` option to confirm each deletion and avoid accidental data loss.
* When removing directories recursively (`-r` or `-R`), make sure you have write permissions for all files and
  subdirectories involved.

**Additional tips:**

* To remove a directory without deleting its contents, use `rm -d mydirectory/`. This will only delete the directory
  itself, leaving any contained files intact.
* If you want to move a file instead of removing it, use the `mv` command (e.g., `mv myfile.txt /path/to/new/location`).

## 2. View Directory/File

Linux provides several commands for viewing directories and files.

Here are some common ones:

```shell
ls  # List directory contents
```

**Option:**

﻿I apologize for that! Here is the list without examples:

* `-a`: Show all files, including hidden ones.
* `-l`: Displays detailed information about each file or directory.
* `-d`: Show directories only
* `-i`: Show inode numbers (file system metadata).
* `-n`: Suppress sorting and grouping.
* `-R`: Recursively list directories (directory traversal)
* `-S`: Sort by size (smallest to largest).
* `-t`: Sort by modification time (newest first).
* `-u`: Show user IDs and group IDs*.
* `-x`: Sort by extension (file type)**

### 2.1 Example

1. The most basic way to view a directory's contents is with the `ls` command:

    ```shell
    ls [directory]
    ```

    * `[directory]`: The path of the directory you want to list.
      Example: `ls /path/to/mydir`

   You can also use options like `-l` for long format, `-a` for all files (including hidden ones), or `-d` for
   directories
   only:

    ```shell
       ls -la /path/to/mydir
    ```

2. `cd` and then `pwd`

   To view the current working directory's contents, you can use:

    ```shell
    cd [directory]  # Change into that directory.
    pwd # Print the name of the current working directory.
    ```

3. `cat`: View the content of file(small file).

    ```shell
    cat [file]
    ```
4. `less` and `more` - View files

   To view the contents of a text file, use:

    ```shell
    less [file]  # Display the file's contents one screen at a time.
    more [file]  # Similar to `less`, but with some differences in behavior.
    ```

## 3. Copy Directory/File

To copy a directory/file, you can use the following command:

The basic syntax is:

```shell
cp [options] source_file destination_file
```

Here's what each part means:

* `source_file`: The file or directory you want to copy.
* `destination_file`: Where you want to copy the file/directory. If it doesn't exist, `cp` will create a new one.

**Options:**

* `-r`: Recursively copy directories.
* `-p`: Preserve file permissions (permissions preservation).
* `-i`: `Interactive`(交互) mode.

***

## 4. Unzip File

### 4.1 ZIP

To unzip a file, you can use the following command:

```shell
unzip [options] archive_file
```

* `archive_file`: The compressed (zipped) file you want to extract.

**Options**

* `-d`: Specify a directory for extracting files.
* `-n`: Do not overwrite existing files (no overwriting).

**Example**

1. Use this option when you want to extract files into a specific directory:

    ```shell
    unzip -d /path/to/extract/directory myarchive.zip
    ```

2. When you're unsure about overwriting existing files:

    ```shell
    unzip -n myarchive.zip
    ```

### 4.2 TAR

Basic syntax:

```shell
tar [options] [archive_file] [file_or_directory]
```

Here's what each part means:

* `archive_file`: The name of the tarball (the archived file).
* `file_or_directory`: The file(s) or directory(ies) to be included in the archive.

**Option:**

* `-c`: Create a new archive.
* `-x`: Extract from an existing archive.
* `v`: Tells `tar` to be verbose, showing what's being extracted and any errors that might occur.

**Examples**

1. Create a new archive.
    ```shell
    tar -c myarchive.tar /path/to/files
    ```
2. Extract all files from an existing archive into the current directory
    ```shell
    tar -xvf myarchive.tar
    ```
3. List the contents of an existing tarball without extracting it
    ```shell
    tar -tf myarchive.tar
    ```
