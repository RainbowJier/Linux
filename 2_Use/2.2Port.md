# Port

## 1. Listing Open Ports

1. `netstat -tlnp`: Displays information about open TCP connections.
    ```shell
    netstat -tlnp | grep 80  # (shows all processes listening on port 80)
    ```

2. `ss -tnlp`: Similar to netstat, but provides more detailed information.

    ```shell
    ss -tnlp | grep 443  #(shows all processes listening on port 443)
    ```

***

## 2. Checking Port Availability

1. `netstat -tlnp | grep <port>`: Checks if a specific port is in use by any process.

    ```shell
    netstat -tlnp | grep 8080  # (checks if port 8080 is available)
    ```

2. `fuser -n <port>`: Displays the PID and name of the process using a specific port.

***

## 1.3 Opening Ports

1. `nc -l -p <port>`: Opens a new connection listening on a specified port.
    ```shell
    nc -l -p 8080   #(opens a new connection listening on port 8080)
   ```
2. `sshd`: Starts the SSH daemon, which listens for incoming connections on port 22.

***

## 1.4 Closing Ports

1. `kill <pid>`: Kills a process that is using a specific port.
    ```shell
    kill $(fuser -n 8080)  # (kills the process using port 8080)
    ```

2. `pkill`: Sends a signal to terminate a process based on its name or command.

***

## 1.5 Port Forwarding

1. `ssh -L <local_port>:localhost:<remote_port> user@host`: Forwards traffic from local port to remote host and port.
    ```shell
    ssh -L 8080:localhost:22 user@example.com  # (forwards SSH connections on port 8080 to example.com)
    ```
